# AwesomeController - An Educational Rebuild of ActionController
## Purpose of AwesomeController
AwesomeController was built to understand and simplify the concepts of ActionController and the functionality it provides. It started by taking a simple example Ruby on Rails app and removing the inheritance of ActionController from the app's controllers. From there, everything was built by following the trail of failures and referencing the real code of Action Controller to understand what it is doing.
