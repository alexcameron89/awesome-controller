# Blog Series Ideas
It would be cool to do a deep dive series on Rails and patterns within Rails. Here are a couple of ideas:

 - Part 1: Boot Process - This blog would describe how a Rails app loads and the meaning behind important config files like `environment.rb`, `config.ru`, etc.
 - Part 2: The Rails Web Request Lifecycle (And what a Rails web worker looks like at runtime)
 - Part 3: Autoloading - Explain how Autoloading and Eagerloading work, and specifically, what the heck is Zeitwerk?
 - Part 4: The Rails Job Lifecycle (And what a Rails job worker looks like at runtime)
 - Part 5: How Action Cable works? It may just be me, but this is a module that I have no experience in, and I believe the same is true for many others.
